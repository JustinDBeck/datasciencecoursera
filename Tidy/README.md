Files associated with the Data Science Track Courses from Coursera.In particular these files are associated with the programming project due in Week 3 of the course. The R script takes some raw data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones and does a degree of tidying and then some simple summarising before outputing a text file. 

CodeBook.md: is the Code Book for the translation of the data from the raw form 
run_analysis.R: is the analysis script which does the tidying
tidyDataMeans.txt: is the output file with the tidy data
README.md: This file
